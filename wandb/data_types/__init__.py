"""This module defines data types for logging rich, interactive visualizations to W&B.

Data types include common media types, like images, audio, and videos,
flexible containers for information, like tables and HTML, and more.

For more on logging media, see [our guide](https://docs.wandb.com/guides/track/log/media)

For more on logging structured data for interactive dataset and model analysis,
see [our guide to W&B Tables](https://docs.wandb.com/guides/data-vis).

All of these special data types are subclasses of WBValue. All of the data types
serialize to JSON, since that is what wandb uses to save the objects locally
and upload them to the W&B server.
